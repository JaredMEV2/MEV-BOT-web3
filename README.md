## Features

- **MEV Shield**
- Built-in protection against unauthorized attempts.
- Automated trading based on blockchain data.
- Built-in token popularity analysis and monitoring of large orders.
- Optimized algorithms for fast transaction execution.

## What's New?

- **Protection** against unauthorized use of other wallets via enhanced smart contracts.
- **Updated Solidity libraries** for performance optimization and compatibility.
- **Uniswap v3 support** for more precise operations and reduced gas fees.
- **Integration with Sushiswap** for advanced trading strategies.
- **Token contract scanning** to detect scams, slippage, liquidity issues, and other risks.
- **Contract function scanning** to detect "blacklisted" addresses and other suspicious data.
- **Balancer integration** for working with liquidity pools and portfolio strategies.
- **Yearn Finance support** for yield automation and investment.

# How It Works?

### Advantages of Version 2:

-   ***Fast scanning of unconfirmed Ethereum network transactions***
-   ***Filter for illiquid and scam tokens***
-   ***Added protection code against hacking and unauthorized function calls***
-   ***AI-powered audit***
-  ***Multi-instance transactions within a single block***

**Function 1:**  Filters tokens based on a blacklist, scam tokens, and slippage to protect against illiquid or scam tokens.

`function filterToken(address token, uint slippage) internal view returns (bool) { if (blacklist[token] || scamTokens[token] || slippage > maxSlippage) { emit TokenFiltered(token, "Token is not eligible"); return false; } return true; }`

**Function 2:**  Protection against unauthorized use of other wallets through improved smart contracts.

`function protectWallet(address wallet) internal view returns (bool) { require(whitelist[wallet], "Unauthorized wallet access"); return true; }`

**Function 3:**  Updated Solidity libraries for performance optimization and compatibility.

`function optimizePerformance() internal view returns (bool) { // Implement optimization logic here return true; }`

**Function 4:**  Integration with Sushiswap for advanced trading strategies.

`function executeSushiSwap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint amountIn) internal { // Sushiswap swap logic here }`

### Important!
***The sale of the source code is not a competitive threat but an additional source of income. 
The code is protected against multi-accounting: a key can be used by only one address. 
Contract deployment is only possible from the address that received the key.***
