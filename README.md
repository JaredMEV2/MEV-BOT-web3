# How It Works?

  

### Advantages of Version 2:

  

-  ***Fast scanning of unconfirmed Ethereum network transactions***

-  ***Filter for illiquid and scam tokens***

-  ***Added protection code against hacking and unauthorized function calls***

-  ***AI-powered audit***

-  ***Multi-instance transactions within a single block***

  

**Function 1:** Filters tokens based on a blacklist, scam tokens, and slippage to protect against illiquid or scam tokens.

  

`function filterToken(address token, uint slippage) internal view returns (bool) { if (blacklist[token] || scamTokens[token] || slippage > maxSlippage) { emit TokenFiltered(token, "Token is not eligible"); return false; } return true; }`

  

**Function 2:** Protection against unauthorized use of other wallets through improved smart contracts.

  

`function protectWallet(address wallet) internal view returns (bool) { require(whitelist[wallet], "Unauthorized wallet access"); return true; }`

  

**Function 3:** Updated Solidity libraries for performance optimization and compatibility.

  

`function optimizePerformance() internal view returns (bool) { // Implement optimization logic here return true; }`

  

**Function 4:** Integration with Sushiswap for advanced trading strategies.

  

`function executeSushiSwap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint amountIn) internal { // Sushiswap swap logic here }`
